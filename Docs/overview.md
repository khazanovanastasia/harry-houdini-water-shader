# Project Overview — Harry Houdini

**Harry Houdini** is an interactive digital art sketch built in Unity.  
The project explores motion, gravity-like influence, and fluid behavior through Shader Graph and simple input-driven logic.

A stylized character sits inside a cube “filled” with simulated water.  
The water is not geometry — it is a shader-driven surface that visually reacts to the viewer’s mouse movements.

The goal of this artwork is to study:
- how minimal interaction can produce emotional tension,
- how a viewer becomes an active participant,
- and how simple shader logic can create the illusion of complex physical behavior.

The piece is available as a WebGL demo on my portfolio.
